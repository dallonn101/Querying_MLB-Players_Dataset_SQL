# Summary
Baseball is a popular sport in which two teams of 9 players take turns batting (hitting a ball) and fielding (catching and throwing hit balls). Points (“runs”) are scored when a hitting team’s player hits a ball and eventually touches all bases before the fielding team’s players have the chance to get them “out.” Baseball is arguably most popular in the United States and Canada, where the MLB (Major League Baseball) has served as the professional association for players since 1876.

In a database called players.db, using a table called players, answer questions about MLB players who’ve played from 1871 to 2023.
